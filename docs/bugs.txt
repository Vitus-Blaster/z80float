singleToStr:
I did:
  x=.111
  x+=x  ;Displays correctly
  x+=x  ;Displays correctly
  x+=x  ;Displays correctly
  x+=x  ;Displays correctly
  x+=x  ;Displays correctly
  x+=x  ;Displays correctly
  x+=x  ;Displays as 41.208 instead of 14.208 !

xinv is failing on 1/pi at the tenth digit
xlog10 is failing on, for example, log(pi)
xlog is failing terribly
xtostr isn't printing cosh(pi) or sinh(pi) correctly (though they are computed correctly). First digit should be 1, not 2.
xtanh is not computing properly. It looks like an issue with the final subtraction
